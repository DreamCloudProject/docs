## Step 1: Setup Local YUM Repository

Now on your UnixOS client machines, add your local repos to the YUM configuration.

### RHEL/CentOS

```shell
vim /etc/yum.repos.d/local-repos.repo
```
Copy and paste the configuration below in the file **local-repos.repo** (make changes where necessary).

```ini
[local-dreamcloud]
name=Dreamcloud Repo
baseurl=https://repouser:welcome@repos.mastermindcms.com/rpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```
Save the file and start using your local YUM mirrors.

Next, run the following command to view your local repos in the list of available YUM repos, on the client machines.

```shell
yum repolist all
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

Import the public key into apt and add the repo to the sources.

```shell
sudo apt-get install gnupg
wget -qO - https://<user>:<password>@repos.mastermindcms.com/debian/debian-repo-public.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://repouser:welcome@repos.mastermindcms.com/debian/ / " > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dreamcloud-repo.list
```

Update the available package list.

```shell
sudo apt-get update
```
